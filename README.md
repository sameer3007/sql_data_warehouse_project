# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

# 🚀 Project Requirements
## Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
1) Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
2) Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
3) Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
4) Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
5) Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.


# 🏗️ Data Architecture
### 1) Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
### 2) Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
### 3) Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
